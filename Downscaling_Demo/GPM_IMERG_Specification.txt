GPM IMERG Final Precipitation L3 1 month 0.1 degree x 0.1 degree V07 (GPM_3IMERGM)
Summary:
Version 07 is the current version of the data set. Older versions will no longer be available and 
have been superseded by Version 07.

The Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) IMERG is a NASA product estimating global 
surface precipitation rates at a high resolution of 0.1° every half-hour beginning 2000. It is part 
of the joint NASA-JAXA Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission, using the GPM Core Observatory 
satellite as the standard to combine precipitation observations from an international constellation 
of satellites using advanced techniques. IMERG can be used for global-scale applications as well as 
over regions with sparse or no reliable surface observations. The fine spatial and temporal resolution 
of IMERG data allows them to be accumulated to the scale of the application for increased skill. 
IMERG has three Runs with varying latencies in response to a range of application needs: rapid-response 
applications (Early Run, 4-h latency), same/next-day applications (Late Run, 14-h latency), and 
post-real-time research (Final Run, 3.5-month latency). While IMERG strives for consistency and accuracy,
satellite estimates of precipitation are expected to have lower skill over frozen surfaces, 
complex terrain, and coastal zones. As well, the changing GPM satellite constellation over time may 
introduce artifacts that affect studies focusing on multi-year changes.
